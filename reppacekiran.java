commit -m "msg content" file name SR->LR
once it is done now its time to update the same files into Remove repository

first we need to come the remote reporsitry

git remote add alias name "url"
to check whether it is connect propertly or not we need to check by using the command called 
git remote -v

how to check gitbash veriosn git --verison 
how to check the git log

suppose if the file is created and uploaded in RR 

again you have made some changed then we need to use commanad 

git comment -a -m "updated  a means add m message content  this for exiting file and modified file .
