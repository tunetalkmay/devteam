kiran first git practice
kiran java file is ready
Git hub is having three stages working area statging area local reporsity

once file is created it will come under WA
once you add that file it will move from WA to SA
After commit the file will move from SA to LR

how to add file into SA
git add file name if suppose we have more files then git add * or git add *.java
as per out requirement we can modify the git add command
once add is done you can see the file in SA by using command call git status

on evert stage identificaiton we can use git status is the command
once add is done then command to move from SA to LA
commit -m "msg content" file name SR->LR
once it is done now its time to update the same files into Remove repository

first we need to come the remote reporsitry

#git remote add alias name "url"
